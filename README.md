# React-js_E-Commerce_Dashboard
The project is built using the MERN stack (React.js, Node.js). This website is designed to interact with the  backend using MongoDB and Node js, and the frontend is developed using React.js. To enhance its attractiveness, React.js Bootstrap and Ant design are used. In my project, I used JWT tokens for user authentication.
